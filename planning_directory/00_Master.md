# Minimal Viable Demo

- Only work on features we will be able to showcase in a 5 minute window
  - Such as Responsive Design

# 01 - User Stories

## Admins

- As an ADMIN I can POST an item because I want to sell my item
- As an ADMIN I can REMOVE an item because I do not want to sell it anymore
- As an ADMIN I can EDIT an item to show it as SOLD because as USER has bought it
- As an ADMIN I can MESSAGE a USER because I want to negotiate a price with the USER

## Users

- As a USER, I can GET featured items, because I want to see what's selling.
- As a USER, I can MESSAGE an admin because I want to buy what they're selling.
- As a USER, I can FAVOURITE items, because I want to check them out later.
- AS a USER, I can FILTER items because I want to look for specific items.
