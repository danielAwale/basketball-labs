## Suggestions from August 17th - Meeting with Jake
- Message page
- change routes to be plural for RESTful
- Use the admin boolean to render the correct logged in page
  - Render based off of the boolean
- Pull Request Best Practices
  - Review the changes for code styling (JS best practices such as helper functions etc.)
  - Flip to the pull request branch and test it in the live app
    - Create a basic checklist of core features to check through for each major pull request
  - Higher level check. e.g. Using EJS (server side rendering) or client-side rendering when checking if a USER or ADMIN is logged in
    - Usually more of a discussion to learn why the approach was taken
