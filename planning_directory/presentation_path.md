"Hi everyone, we're Team This is Just a Tribute and this is our buy and sell project, Gatherer, a marketplace for Magic The Gathering trading cards, similar to craigslist or Kijiji. This is a full stack, multi-page app that is currently locally hosted. I'll pass things off to Jack and Jas to run you through our core features."

"John finds the new card that Alice has posted and is immediately interested. He decides to favorite the card to make sure he doesn't forget about it if he leaves to go and do something else."

### Jack - Handoff
"Now we'll send it back to Noah to talk about the further features we would want to add."


### Noah - Outro
"Thanks for listening everyone. The additional features we would add, given extra time, would be to increase our search filtering capabilities, hover over a card to see an enlarged version with additional information, have each card have it's own page on the site, implement log-in authentication and hashing, and finally, expand to further markets."

"Thanks for watching our presentation and we're looking forward to watching everyone else's!"

### Everyone
- We all say thanks and bye.
